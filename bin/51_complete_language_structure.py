# What python library means?
# --------
# - python library can one or more module like mymodule.py
# - python library can one or more package like mypackage
# - python library can one or more frameworks
#       - framework is like mymodule or package
#       - Difference
#           -- In mymodule.py/mypackage we are keeping only definitions
#           -- In framework, some common tasks are implemented
#           Example: Testing Framework: Here tests are different for different
#               projects but executing one by one, capturing total success/failure
#               etc are common. These common things are implemented

# Complete python programming language structure
# --------
# PART-1: Python Programming Language
#       - data types, if, for, while, functions, classes etc
#       - Using PART1 we can develop anything from the scratch
#       - We already developed: assignments-1 to 17
#
# PART-2: builtins
#       - few variables, functions and classes are predefined
#       - which we can use it
#       - by default imported
#       - complete list: print(dir(__builtins__))
#       - We already used many
#       - Documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html
#
# PART-3: Standard Libraries
#       - few libraries are getting installed when we install python
#       - Difference
#           -- buitins are imported by default
#           -- Standard Libraries we need to import and use
#       - Location: C:\Python312\Lib
#       - Documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html
#
# PART-4: 3rd Party / External Libraries
#       - MAIN BIG Repository for all python libraries
#       - Location: https://pypi.org/
#       - Documentation: https://pypi.org/
#
# PART-5: User defined libraries
#       - which we develop
#       - We already developed
#       1) mymodule.py
#       2) mypackage
